        <p>This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for OdinLite Mobile App and Management Console.
            This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by these applications. It will notify you of the
            following:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the applications, how it is used
                and with whom it may be shared.
            </li>
            <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
            <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
            <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="text-bold">Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</p>
        <p>
            We are the sole owners of the information collected via these applications. We only have access to/collect
            information in the interests of fulfilling the application suite's purpose.
            We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use your information to contact you if required in relation to account upkeeping. Information
            gathered
            via the Mobile App will be used to generate company reports for the Management Console Company Account
            and shared with the company's registered console users. Only console users directly added to the company
            account will have
            access to these reports.</p>
        <p>
            We will not share
            your information with any third party
            outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to process a payment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-bold"> Your Access to and Control Over Information</p>
        <p>
            You may opt out of any future contacts from us or any future information gathering by us at any time.
            You can do the following at any time by contacting us via email:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
            <li>Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
            <li>Have us delete any data we have about you.</li>
            <li>Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-bold"> Security </p>
        <p> We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website,
            your information is protected both online and offline.
        </p>

        <p> Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
            transmitted to us in a secure way.
            You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for
            “https” at the beginning of the
            address of the web page.
        </p>

        <p> While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your
            information offline. Only employees
            who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are
            granted access to personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <p class="text-bold">Updates</p>
        <p> Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.</p>

        <p> If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email:
